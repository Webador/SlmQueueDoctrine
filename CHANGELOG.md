# 0.7.1

- We now use querybuilder for poping job from the queue to better support "Hardcoded LIMIT 1 doesn't work wih Oracle, as Oracle doesn't know LIMIT". This means we also require doctrine/dbal:^2.5 minimal, which could be an issue if you're using older packages.

First release of SlmQueueDoctrine which bring it on par with its parent SlmQueue 0.3.0-beta1

Comes with unittests, bug fixes and general happiness but please be aware of the following, if you are upgrading from an earlier version...

- Existing jobs are not compatible (Job content is now serialized). Make sure you empty the queue before upgrading.
- It is suggested that you recreate the table from data/queue_default.sql as the schema changed in minor ways.
- The ability to configure the queue defaults has been removed. Any queue specific configuration now goes into the queues configuration of slm_queue.local.php
