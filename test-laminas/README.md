This is a sample Laminas MVC project, that we set-up or testing purposes. It is configured to be able to run a single
job. Test file `test.php` will schedule the job, and validate that it ran.

Note that `laminas-cli` will bootstrap the application when `vendor/bin/laminas` is executed in this
directory. That is because it will find the `config/application.config.php` file.
